Explain how you get the result3 using what methods and which type of similarity and 
what information. Explain why using these settings will get the best result


I build a user profile for each user using user information and movie information.
The movies file is separated considered according to their genres. Their genres are
translated into integers in the system. Each movie corresponds to a set of integers
of genres except that some movies are missing genres. Movies of each genre are 
regarded separately. That is, in the original user-based approach, an average rating
is computed to each user. And now, several average ratings, each corresponds to a 
genre, is computed. These average ratings are saved in each userâ€™s profile.
Besides, each user profile contains gender, age and occupation.
I make use of user profile similarity and pure user-based approach to calculate
similarity between two users. If they are similar in both user profiles and rating
history, then they have a higher possibility to rate other files.
The similarity calculation between two user profiles is based on observation and
intuition. I discuss with a psychology student to give weights to each attribute.

Specifically, initially two user profiles have similarity (called amplification) 1.
If they are same in gender, then amplification *= 5
If they are same in occupation, then amplification *= 1.1
More difference in ages, more likely two users tend to prefer different movies,
so amplification *= (5 - 0.05 * abs(age1-age2))
Besides, average ratings for each genre of movies are also taken into consideration:
amplification *= 1 + (0.5 - diffInEachGenre)
The result amplification can be multiplied to other similarity results.

This method can give slightly better result than pure user-based approach because
it not only considers history ratings but also takes into consideration user and item attributes. I think with more data, this approach can be better than best item-based
approach as well.
